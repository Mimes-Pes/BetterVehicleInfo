# BetterVehicleInfo
It is a Seamoth piloting upgrade mod, the upgrade is unlocked with Base Upgrade Console. Making this upgrade requires
- Computer Chip,
- Advanced Wiring Kit and
- Gold.
It is a mod which improves dashboard and adds gears to Seamoth:
- Gear 1 = 25% speed,
- 2 = 50% speed,
- 3 = 75% speed,
- 4 = vanilla speed,
- 5 = 125% speed,
- 6 = 150% speed.
Reasoning behind slow speed is to facilitate nice approaches to bases etc.
Mod also adjusts energy usage depending on speed 1 = lowest usage than vanilla, 5 and 6 = exponentially higher usage - very high resistance at high speed. Extra gear state (1-6) info is implemented, and it shows bottom RHS just above Health, Charge and Temp panel. It shows which gear is Seamoth currently in. Mod has extensive customisation options.
